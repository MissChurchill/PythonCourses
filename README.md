# PythonCourses

These are my files created during my learning of Python completing the pre-work for my Code Louisville Data Science Part 1 course.  
I have enjoyed learning Python and really enjoyed the PluralSight videos that I followed along and coded with as I was learning.
I highly recommend the following PluralSight Videos if you would also like to follow along to learn Python:

1. Core Python: Big Picture
2. Practical Python for Beginners
3. Python: Using Lists, Dictionaries, Loops, Files, and Modules (Interactive)
4. Python: Variables, Data Types and Conditionals (Interactive)
